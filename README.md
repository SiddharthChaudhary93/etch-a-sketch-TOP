# etch-a-sketch-TOP

A regular etch a sketch machine in which we can change the size of the grid.
The colors are automatically applied based on a random function and the event listener of mouseenter


### important things to remember
* clear the grid when changing the size otherwise new elements will be appended on the previous one
* height of the individial div element
* do not need both grid-template-column and the row
* max-width and min height for the grid to fix its size
